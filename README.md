## NOTES

+ Do not run the install script without knowing what you're looking at. As with anything, don'trun random stuff from the internet
+ Install script and program list is not guarenteed to be updated, they may have some missing deps for the config files
+  The cacheAll script will cache all of the wallust colorscheme from these images. This makes it significantly faster to load on startup/sway reload on slower systems. 
While recommended, it will work just fine without
